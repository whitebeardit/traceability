# Glossary of Terms

- **Correlation-ID**: Unique identifier used to track a request across multiple services. In Traceability, this is typically the OpenTelemetry TraceId.
- **Activity**: .NET class that represents a span in distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry standard). Contains TraceId, SpanId, and trace context.
- **TraceId**: Unique identifier for a trace (distributed request flow). Part of OpenTelemetry Activity, automatically propagated across services.
- **Span**: A single operation within a trace. In Traceability, each HTTP request and HTTP call creates a span (Activity).
- **W3C Trace Context**: Industry standard for distributed tracing, defined by W3C. Uses `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers.
- **traceparent**: W3C Trace Context header that carries trace context (TraceId, SpanId, flags) across service boundaries.
- **tracestate**: W3C Trace Context header that carries additional trace context (baggage) as key-value pairs.
- **AsyncLocal**: .NET class that stores values specific to an asynchronous context. Used as fallback when Activity is not available.
- **DelegatingHandler**: Base class for HTTP handlers that can be chained
- **Enricher**: Serilog component that adds properties to log events
- **ScopeProvider**: Microsoft.Extensions.Logging component that manages logging scopes
- **Conditional Compilation**: Conditional compilation using `#if` directives to include code based on conditions
- **Middleware**: Component in HTTP pipeline that processes requests and responses
- **MessageHandler**: Handler in ASP.NET Web API pipeline
- **HttpModule**: Module in traditional ASP.NET pipeline
- **Source**: Field that identifies the origin/service that is generating the logs
- **Traceability**: Ability to track a request across multiple services using correlation-id/trace-id
- **Socket Exhaustion**: Problem that occurs when many HTTP connections are created without reuse, exhausting available sockets
- **IHttpClientFactory**: .NET factory that manages HTTP connection pool, preventing socket exhaustion
- **OpenTelemetry**: Industry standard for observability (tracing, metrics, logs). Traceability integrates with OpenTelemetry Activities.
- **ActivitySource**: .NET class that creates Activities (spans). Traceability uses `TraceabilityActivitySource` for centralized Activity creation.
